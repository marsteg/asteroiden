# asteroiden

An Asteroids clone.

You will need the pygame library. Then just run:
	 python3 main.py


## Controls:

G: Gigashot
Space: Shot
W, A, S, D: Tank Controls


## my notes
- how could i have a set of screens? 
	- need something like a door, that will trigger the load of a new screen and position when colliding with the player


Bugs: 
- if the player leaves the screen, he is gone
